# <Password Generator>

## Description

Have you ever been in need of a new secure, randomly generated password but just dont have ideas? What if you're having issues meeting specific password criterias for a new log in password? Well, This random password generator takes the guessing out of making a password? In this Challenge I used JavaScript to create an interactive password generator where you choose the criteria and in return you get a randomly generated password? During the duration of this project i've learned the importance of for loops, proper use of if/else, and a fun one for me was the math.floor!

## Installation

Below are the installation steps:
1. Create your variables
2. Decide on what functions are needed and write out your skeleton functions as placeholders to return to
3. Begin diving into the function arguments.
4. Make sure to create a function that actually runs the code you are trying to create. Otherwise nothing will execute!

## Usage

This can be used to create a random password with user specified criteria. You can choose the length, whether or not you want numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or special characters!
